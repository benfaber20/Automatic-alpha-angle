This information is to guide the use of the attached script. 

1) you need to plot outline points to be used by these scripts. BoneFinder is freely available software to do this automatically or manually. 

2) The output points need to provided in the format shown by example_points_file.txt. Each row after the "{" is an x,y coordinate for the points. The row after "{" will be read as point 0 by the code. 

3) These points files need to be stored in the same folder

4) A list of points files needs to be provided for the script - see example_list.txt

5) If you have a different number of points to those described in [insert Wellcome paper]
 then you will need to alter the circle fitting definitions.
 
 6) To use this code on Right Hips then the circle interception code needs to be altered unless the images have been flipped to appear like Left sided hips.
